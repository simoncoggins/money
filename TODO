Transactions:
* When destroying a pattern, or removing a pattern when it no longer matches, still some issues reassigning lower patterns
* Convert transaction/index view to use partial and treat untagged as special case
* How to update current tag when using after_destroy in tag_assignments model?
* Update graph model functions to properly send output to json using formats
* Better validation for split transactions option
* Allow transactions to be hidden (from graphs and shaded on list)

Transaction graph:
* Try to load initial data without ajax
* Black bar border? Or hack flot to not show empty values
* Fix monthly bar width
* Show axis even for empty graph
* Add calendar/slider to limit date range
* Don't alter checkbox state when switching time period
* Consider starting with only some tags checked
* Think about tag list order
* Dollars on y axis
* seriesIndex wrong when only some tags are checked
* Show taglist whenever mouse outside graph
* Something wrong with the daily plot (intermittent)

Balance graph:
* Allow viewing graphs by date range, tags
* If no negative points, originSeries not found
* Add one more point to graph at RHS with same amount and date+1day (so last transaction hoverable)
* Get rid of times from x axis
